## Game Design
With a theme of "Take Care" to inspire our game design we early on decided to go in the direction of farming and taking care of plants, which over time evolved into flowers with magic effects, and then the obvious choice was to make the character a bee, so we went with that. The main game loop involves the player flying to flowers to collect pollen of various colors and then using that pollen to plant new flowers. The goal is to cultivate a colorful flower garden.

## Technology
